# Configure here which dependency updates should be merged automatically.
# The recommended configuration is the following:
- match:
      # Only merge patches for production dependencies
      dependency_type: production
      update_type: "semver:patch"
- match:
      # Except for security fixes, here we allow minor patches
      dependency_type: production
      update_type: "security:minor"
- match:
      # and development dependencies can have a minor update, too
      dependency_type: development
      update_type: "semver:minor"

# The syntax is based on the legacy dependabot v1 automerged_updates syntax, see:
# https://dependabot.com/docs/config-file/#automerged_updates
