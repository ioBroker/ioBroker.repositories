#
# This workflow scans a dedicated list of adapters (hardcode at setStableTag.js) and ensures that the release number listed 
# at sources-dist-stable.json and the release tagged as 'stable' at npm are identical. If a difference is detected, the dist-tag 
# at npmjs is changed to meet the contents of sources-dist-stable.json.
#
# This workflow is triggered by any push and additionally runs once a day
