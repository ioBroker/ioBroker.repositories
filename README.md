# ioBroker.repositories

This is github project for storage of latest and stable repositories.

Write ```npm run update``` to just get new adapters from sources-dist.json into sources-dist-stable.json.
And write ```npm run update adapterName``` to write latest version of adapterName into sources-dist-stable.json

## Update of the version in stable
1. Be sure that the version is tested in forum by users or you fix the critical bug with that.
2. Delete the versionTime if exists

## Add a new adapter to the latest repository
1. Fork this repo and clone your fork
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run addToLatest -- --name <adapter-name> --type <adapter-type>`  
    (replace `<adapter-name>` with your adapter's name (without 'iobroker.' prefix) and `<adapter-type>` with the adapter type)
4. Push a commit with the changes to `sources-dist.json`
5. Create a PR

## Requirements for adapter to get added to the latest repository

*already required for latest repository*

1. Your github repository must have name "ioBroker.<adaptername>". **B** is capital in "ioBroker", but in the package.json the *name* must be low case, because npm does not allow upper case letters. Your repository must have "topics". Add these with `Manage topics`.
2. Do not use in the title the words "ioBroker" or "Adapter". It is clear anyway, that it is adapter for ioBroker.
3. *title* in io-package.json (common) is simple short name of adapter in english. *titleLang* is object that consist short names in many languages. *Lang* ist not german `LÃ¤nge`, but english `LANGuages`.
4. Adapter needs to have a README.md with description, detail information and changelog. English is mandatory. Other languages are welcome. See [Example of README.md](#example-of-readme-md).

   **In README.md, there must be a link to the device or the manufacturer's website. Devices must have a photo. Services do not require a photo, but are still welcome.**
5. Adapter must have a predefined license.
6. Please remove www, widgets and docs directories (admin/tab_m.html, admin/custom_m.html) if not used.
7. Adapter needs to have at least Adapter basic testing (installing, running) using Travis-CI (optionally and Appveyor). More information in Forum from apollon77 (Just take from other adapters the samples)
8. Define one of the types in io-package.json. See details [here](#types)
9. Define one of the connection types (if applied) in io-package.json. See details [here](#connection-types)
10. All states must have according [valid roles](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/blob/master/doc/STATE_ROLES.md#state-roles) (and not just "state")
11. Include "author" in io-package.json and "authors" in io-package.json. See [here](#authors).
12. Adapter needs to be available as package on npm. See [How to publish on npm](#how-to-publish-on-npm)
13. iobroker organisation must be added as owner to npm package. [Why and how to do that.](#add-owner-to-packet)
14. Add your adapter into the list (first latest and after that into stable, when tested).
   Examples of entries you can find [here](#samples).
15. No new adapters will be accepted to repo without admin3 Configuration dialog. Admin2 dialog is optional!
16. Check and Follow the Coding best practices listed below

*Note:* you can watch the video about it (only german) on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N8fsJcAdlE)
*Note:* There is a helper https://adapter-check.iobroker.in/ to check many points automatically. Just place your github adapter repo there, e.g `https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin` and press enter or on the check button.

## Development and Coding best practices
* Best use the adapter creator (https://github.com/ioBroker/create-adapter) or get a fresh relevant version from the Template Repository (https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template) to start coding to always get the latest basic version and also updates. You should not always copy basic files from former adapters!
* Do not copy a package.json or io-package.json after an installation because some fields might have been added on installation! e.g. io-package with common.installedFrom eds to be removed
* **Use the Adapter Checker and fix all issues shown there: https://adapter-check.iobroker.in/**
* Respect Object and state definitions, types and roles Values not defined here should not be used. Discussions about missing roles or types are welcome:
  * https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/objectsschema.md#object-types
  * https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/stateroles.md
* Only commit .vscode, .idea or other IDE files/helper directories to GitHub if there is a need to. This is to prevent other users settings to interfere with yours or make PRs more complex because of this.
* If you do not need onState/ObjectChange/Message please do not implement it
* if you need to store passwords please encrypt them in Admin! You can check e.g. Apollon77/iobroker.meross for example code in index_m.html and main.js
* add all editable fields from index_m.html to io-package native with their default values
* **You need to make sure to clean up ALL resources in "unload". Clear all Timers, Intervals, close serial ports and servers and end everything. Else this will break the compact mode**
* **Please test in compact mode!** Especially starting, running, stopping adapter and verify that nothing runs any longer and no logs are triggered and also a new start works.
* Be careful with "setObject" because it overwrites the object and (especially in js-controller < 2.2) custom settings like history may be removed by this! Use setObjectNotExists or read the object to detect if it exists and use extendObject to update.
* get familiar with the "ack" concept of ioBroker. Adapters normally set all "final" values with ack=true and these are mostly ignored in onStateChange handlers. ack=false are commands that normally are handled by Adapters.
* Do not use process.exit() because this breaks compact mode. Use adapter.terminate() if the method is available.
* If you consider using a scheduling library in conjunction with external/cloud services then consider the potential consequences! If your adapter becomes successfull then all users will do their calls to the external service in the exact same second. This can become a DOS stile "attack" to that server with bad consequences. Additioanlly to that using a Scheduling library just to implement intervals is overkill :-) setInterval/setTimeout should be completely sufficiant AND has the good side effect that requests are not done all at the same second, but start when the adapter starts.
* When using Intervals together with external communication think about timeout and error cases - an interval triggers the next call also if the last has not finished. So requests might pile up and you DOS the external API. A better practice might be to use setTimeout and set at the end of one call for the next call
* If you use "connections" to other systems (Websockets, MQTT, TCP, Serial or other) please also implement the info.connection state (directly create objects by including in io-package) and set the connection value accordingly. Using this enables Admin to differentiate the status between green (ok, running), yellow (basically running but not connected) and red (not running).
* Consider and understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and make sure to know what will happen in parallel and what makes more sence to be sequencially! It is ok to use callbacks or Promises/async/await - the latter makes it more easy to understand and control how your code really flows.
* Consider using ESLint or other JavaScript code and type checker to see errors in your code before releasing a new version.
* **Please activate adapter testing with at least package- and integration-tests on Travis-CI** GitHub Actions are not enough at the moment because they do not allow us to get an easy overview, especially when we want to see how our adapters behave with new nodejs versions.
* The adapter testing using Travis and/or GitHub Actions is not for us - it is for you! Please check it after pushing changes to GitHub and before telling it to users or publish an NPM package. If testing is "red" you should check the testing log to see whats broken.
* If you like to increase testing you can start implementing adapter specific tests that always run when you push changes to GitHub.
* You can/should use https://translator.iobroker.in/ to auto translate all relevant texts into all needed languages by providing the english text
* If an adapter instance want to generate an object structure it should use objects from the type device, channel or folder to define sub-structures and provide objects of type state only on the last "level". Different levels can be separated by a ".". An object of the type "state" should never have more objecte below it. The allowed field for the relevant object types are documented in https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/objectsschema.md#core-concept

## Add a new adapter to the stable repository
1. Fork this repo and clone your fork
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run addToStable -- --name <adapter-name> --version <stable-version>`  
    (replace `<adapter-name>` with your adapter's name and `<stable-version>` with the version that should be added to the stable repo)
4. Push a commit with the changes to `sources-dist-stable.json`
5. Create a PR

### Requirements for adapter to get added to the stable repository

Additionally to all above listed points:

15. Forum thread with question to test the adapter.
16. Some feedback on [forum](http://forum.iobroker.net).
17. **Important** Discovery function! If device can be found automatically (USB, IP) it must be implemented in discovery adapter.

## How-to
### How to publish on npm

https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages

### Add owner to packet
We are really happy, that other developers are contributing to ioBroker. But some of them with the time lost the enthusiasms and stop support and maintain the adapter.

There is no problem with github repository. We can just fork it and maintain it in our organisation, but the situation with **npm** is different.

If some name is blocked (e.g. iobroker.rpi) we cannot publish the changed adapter under the same name, we must change the name to e.g. iobroker.rpi2.

Than we must change the ioBroker repositories and the user must install the new adapter and migrate the old settings and objects into new adapter.

This is not suitable.

Because of that we ask you to give ioBroker organisation publish rights to update the npm package. We will use it only in emergency or if author do not react to our requests.

To add the ioBroker organisation to npm packet, you must write following, after the packet is published:

```npm access grant read-write iobroker:developers iobroker.<adaptername>```

If the command does not work just add bluefox as owner.

```npm owner add bluefox iobroker.<adaptername>```

### Example of README.md

https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin/blob/master/README.md

Much better is to write documentation separately for every language like here:

https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin/blob/master/io-package.json#L171

and the files are here https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin/tree/master/docs

And make the link in your readme file to this files, like here: https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.javascript/blob/master/README.md

### Licenses
Following licenses are used now in ioBroker project:

* MIT (used for most of adapters and core)
* Apache 2.0
* CC-BY
* OFL-1.1
* EPL
* LGPL
* GPLv3
* GPLv2
* CC-BY-NC
* CC-BY-NC-SA

You can choose the suitable license here: https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/

Of course you can add your own licenses, even WTFPL.

You must of course take in count the licenses of components, that used in your adapter. E.g. if you use main packet under GPLv2 license, you cannot make CC-BY-NC from that.

### Testing
See how testing is implemented on ioBroker.template:
 - https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/tree/master/test
 - https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/blob/master/package.json#L39
 - Activate tests on travis-ci.org: https://github.com/mbonaci/mbo-storm/wiki/Integrate-Travis-CI-with-your-GitHub-repo
 - Activate appveyor (for windows) if applicable: https://www.appveyor.com/

You can find some help in this [PDF](http://forum.iobroker.net/download/file.php?id=11259) (Only german) See **Adapter Testing** Section.

### Types
The io-package.json must have attribute type in common part.
An example can be seen [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/blob/1e48d01e69c9ad15c70ab8dced572a4d6882ae0d/io-package.json#L76):

You can see the types of existing adapters [here](http://download.iobroker.net/list.html#sortCol=type&sortDir=0) and try to find the similar one.

### Connection types
If your adapter control some device/car/house the adapter could be connected with with various methods and receives data via different protocols.

Define `connectionType` in `common` part of `io-package.json` as:
- `local` - if the communication with device do not requie cloud access.
- `cloud` - if the communication is via cloud.

Define `dataSource` in `common` as:
- `poll` - Querying the status means that an update may be noticed later.
- `push` - ioBroker will be notified when a new status is available.
- `assumption` - The status of the device cannot be determined. ioBroker takes status based on last ioBroker command.

#### Defined categories for non-repo adapters
* pilight -	 iot-systems
* samsung2016 -	multimedia
* scriptgui	- logic
* viessmann	- climate-control
* vuplus - multimedia
